<h3>What is TravelList?</h3>
<p>TravelList is a community to share, discuss, and learn about travel blogging. </p>

<p>There is an amazing community of travel bloggers who share their stories from all corners of the globe. Some of us are seasoned experts, some are on the way, and some are just getting started. We believe they all deserve a place to connect in an open community.</p> 

<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>Anyone with an interest in travel blogging, such as:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Seasoned pro&#39;s who love to teach what they&#39;ve learned</li>
  <li>Great writers who deserve to have their content read</li>
  <li>Beginners who are just getting started and have a lot of questions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Who started it?</h3>
<p>TravelList was created by Fredrik Sch&#246;&#246;n and <a href="http://www.postify.com/">Postify</a>. We&#39;re always in touch with great independent travel bloggers and we wanted a place like this to exist ourselves, so we created it.</p>
