    <h1>About Closing Call</h1>
  

<h3>What is Closing Call?</h3>
<p>Closing Call is a community to share, discuss, and learn about sales techniques and strategies.</p>


<h3>Why was it made?</h3>
<p>There are plenty of online resources to learn sales. From blogs written by the experts, to questions and answers on Quora. However, before Closing Call there wasn't a place online to engage with other people who share a passion for sales. We created Closing Call firstly, because we personally wished something like it existed, and secondly to provide a place for the passionate sales community to learn how to become better salespeople.</p>


<h3>Who made this?</h3>
<p>Closing Call was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesepember">James Pember</a> from <a href="https://www.spartasales.com/">Sparta</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangum">Ryan Gum</a> from <a href="http://attach.io">Attach</a>, Saas startups focused on sales productivity and enablement.</p>

<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>Anyone with an interest in sales:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Inbound & Outbound Sales Reps, Business Development Managers, Prospectors and Account Managers who want to improve their numbers</li>
  <li>Sales Managers who want to improve the performance of their team</li>
  <li>Startup entrepreneurs who want to learn how to sell their product</li>
  <li>People who are just getting started and want to accelerate their learning</li>
